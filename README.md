# Car-price-prediction-model
This project is to observe how much the current price for the used car decrease from market price and its original price. The data are derived from a previous final year project that belongs to a senior where the data scraped from Mudah.my and the market prices are collected from a bank for comparison. The data then is used to predict the used car price using Orange Canvas. The prediction process uses classification techniques which are Random Forest and AdaBoost classifier. This project can help people who want to buy used cars to make a better decision as well as to know how much the used cars worth based on the prediction that are presented.
